#Problem
Reverse a C style string

#Constraints and Assumptions
* NUL terminated
* only ascii chars

#Notes
##Examples

##Time and Space Complexity
O(n)
...

#Psuedocode
find end of string
start one ptr at start, one at end
swap chars until same

#Postmortem
* Always remember to increment/decrement points in loops
* Also careful with pointer arithmetic
** I messed on finding the tail since I included the `\0`
