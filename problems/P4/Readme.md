# P4 - Counting specific chars 
Write a program that takes an input from user and counts blanks, tabs and newlines.


# Motivation
Here we are practicing reading chars, loops and arrays

# Thought Process
* The characters are counted one by one as we parse them.
* We use an array of ints to represent each character we want to count to avoid literring with vars
