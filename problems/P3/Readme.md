# TODO P3 - Write the function any(s1,s2) , which returns the first location in the string s1 where any character from the string s2 occurs, or -1 if s1 contains no characters from s2 . (The standard library function strpbrk does the same job but returns a pointer to the location.)

# Motivation
* Learn about arrays and loops and functions, yay :+1:

# Assumptions
* ASCII chars only


# Logic
```
any(inout s1, in s2)
   src_index = 0
   dest_index = 0
   for src_index = 0; *src_index
      for k=0; k != \0; k++
         if s1[i]

```
