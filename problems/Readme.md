# Intro
Contains an assortment of interview style problems with links to solutions and code. Good for a quick review.

# P1 - Is given number a palindrome?
Implement a function that checks whether a positive number is a palindrome or not. For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.

See at [P1](P1)

# P2 - Removing specified characters from a given array (K&R sec 2.8)
Design an algorithm to remove a specified char from an array. No extra buffer may be used.

# P3- Write an alternate version of squeeze(s1,s2) that deletes each character in the string s1 that matches any character in the string s2.

# P4 - Counting specific chars
Write a program that takes an input from user and counts blanks, tabs and newlines.

# P5 - Write your own version of wc (K&R C 1.5.4)
Here is a unix program called `wc`. This is what it does:
```
Sankets-Mac-mini:cs-refresh sanket$ echo "island in the sun" | wc
       1       4      18
```
Shows 1 line, 4 words and 18 characters
Write it from scratch.

# P6 - Write your own strlen() - (K&R 2.3)

# P7 - Write a program that accepts several lines and identifies the longest one (K&R 1.9)

# P8 - Write a pseudorandom number generator - (K&R 2.7)

# P9 - Write htoi() - (K&R ex2.3)

# P10 - Write a clone of `strcat()`

# P11 - Write a function `any(s1,s2)` which returns first location in string s1 where any char from s2 occurs, or -1 if s1 contains no chars from s1 (clone of `strpbrk()`) (K&R ex:2.5)

# P12 - Write a function setbits(x,p,n,y) that returns x with the n bits that begin at position p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving the other bits unchanged.

# P13 - Function getbits(x,p,n) that returns the right-adjusted n-bit field of x that begins at position p

# P14 - Write a function `bitcount(unsigned x)` which counts the number of 1's in an integer (K&R sec 2.10)

#P15 - Given a 2d array, return all sets of indices where the values are exactly the same


# TODO's

Implement strstr() to Find a Substring in a String - [http://articles.leetcode.com/implement-strstr-to-find-substring-in/](http://articles.leetcode.com/implement-strstr-to-find-substring-in/)

Write a linked list ([http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex33.html](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex33.html))

Write a function setbits(x,p,n,y) that returns x with the n bits that begin at position p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving the other bits unchanged(Listing krx206)

Write a function invert(x,p,n) that returns x with the n bits that begin at position p inverted (i.e., 1 changed into 0 and vice versa), leaving the others unchanged.(Listing krx207)

Write a function rightrot(x,n) that returns the value of the integer x rotated to the right by n bit positions.(K&R ex 2.8)
