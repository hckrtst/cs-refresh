# Intro
Contains an assortment of interview style problems with links to solutions and code. Good for a quick review.

# P1 - Is given number a palindrome?
Implement a function that checks whether a positive number is a palindrome or not. For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.

See at [P1](P1)

# P2 - Removing specified characters from a given array
Design an algorithm to remove a specified char from an array. No extra buffer may be used.

# P3 - Removing duplicates from an array
Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. 
> NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not.

# P4 - Counting specific chars 
Write a program that takes an input from user and counts blanks, tabs and newlines.

# P5 - Write your own version of wc (K&R C 1.5.4)
Here is a unix program called `wc`. This is what it does:
```
Sankets-Mac-mini:cs-refresh sanket$ echo "island in the sun" | wc
       1       4      18
```
Shows 1 line, 4 words and 18 characters
Write it from scratch.

# P6 - Write your own strlen() - (K&R 2.3)

# P7 - Write a program that accepts several lines and identifies the longest one (K&R 1.9)

# P8 - Write a pseudorandom number generator - (K&R 2.7)

# P9 - Write htoi() - (K&R ex2.3)

# P? - Implement strstr() to Find a Substring in a String - [http://articles.leetcode.com/implement-strstr-to-find-substring-in/](http://articles.leetcode.com/implement-strstr-to-find-substring-in/)

# P? - Write a linked list ([http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex33.html](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex33.html))
