# Intro
Contains an assortment of interview style problems with links to solutions and code. Good for a quick review.

# P1 - Is given number a palindrome?
Implement a function that checks whether a positive number is a palindrome or not. For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.

# P2 - Removing specified characters from a given array
Design an algorithm to remove a specified char from an array. No extra buffer may be used.

# P3 - Removing duplicates from an array
Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. 
> NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not.
