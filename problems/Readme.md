# Intro
Contains an assortment of interview style problems with links to solutions and code. Good for a quick review.

# P1 - Is given number a palindrome?
Implement a function that checks whether a positive number is a palindrome or not. For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.

See at [P1](P1)

# P2 - Removing specified characters from a given array (K&R sec 2.8)
Design an algorithm to remove a specified char from an array. No extra buffer may be used.

# P3- Write an alternate version of squeeze(s1,s2) that deletes each character in the string s1 that matches any character in the string s2. 

# P4 - Counting specific chars
Write a program that takes an input from user and counts blanks, tabs and newlines.

# P5 - Write your own version of wc (K&R C 1.5.4)
Here is a unix program called `wc`. This is what it does:
```
Sankets-Mac-mini:cs-refresh sanket$ echo "island in the sun" | wc
       1       4      18
```
Shows 1 line, 4 words and 18 characters
Write it from scratch.

# P6 - Write your own strlen() - (K&R 2.3)

# P7 - Write a program that accepts several lines and identifies the longest one (K&R 1.9)

# P8 - Write a pseudorandom number generator - (K&R 2.7)

# P9 - Write htoi() - (K&R ex2.3)

# TODO P10 - Write a clone of `strcat()`

# TODO P? - Implement strstr() to Find a Substring in a String - [http://articles.leetcode.com/implement-strstr-to-find-substring-in/](http://articles.leetcode.com/implement-strstr-to-find-substring-in/)

# TODO P? - Write a linked list ([http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex33.html](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex33.html))

# TODO P? - Write a function `any(s1,s2)` which returns first location in string s1 where any char from s2 occurs, or -1 if s1 contains no chars from s1 (clone of `strpbrk()`) (K&R ex:2.5)
